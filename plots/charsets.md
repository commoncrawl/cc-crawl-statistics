Character Encoding of HTML Pages
================================

The [character set or encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) of HTML pages only is identified by [Tika](https://tika.apache.org/)'s [AutoDetectReader](https://tika.apache.org/1.18/api/org/apache/tika/detect/AutoDetectReader.html). The table shows the percentage how character sets have been used to encode HTML pages crawled by the latest monthly crawls.
