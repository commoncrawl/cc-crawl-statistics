Distribution of Languages
=========================

The language of a document is identified by [Compact Language Detector 2 (CLD2)](https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2). It is able to identify 160 different languages and up to 3 languages per document. The table lists the percentage covered by the primary language of a document (returned first by CLD2). So far, only HTML pages are passed to the language detector.
