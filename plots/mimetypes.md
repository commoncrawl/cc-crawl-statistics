MIME Types
==========

The crawled content is dominated by HTML pages and contains only a small percentage of other document formats. The tables show the percentage of the top 100 media or MIME types of the latest monthly crawls.

While the first table is based the `Content-Type` HTTP header, the second uses the MIME type detected by [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) based on the actual content. The underlying data including page counts is provided in [mimetypes.csv](./mimetypes.csv) resp. [mimetypes_detected.csv](./mimetypes_detected.csv).
