Top-Level Domains By Year and Continent
=======================================

Many top-level domains can be mapped to geographic regions, for example, the country-code TLDs or regional one (`.asia`). For other domains, such as `.com` or `.net` this is not possible. 

The aggregation by year and the percentage allows to better understand the long-term trends of top-level domain and geographical coverage. For the latter, TLDs are mapped to continents.

The underlying data of the plot is provided in the table below or as CSV ([tlds-by-year-and-continent.csv](./tlds-by-year-and-continent.csv)).

The second table shows the percentage of the 16 most common top-level domains. The data is also provided as CSV: [selected-tlds-by-year.csv](./selected-tlds-by-year.csv).
