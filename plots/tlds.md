Top-Level Domains
=================

[Top-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain) (abbrev. "TLD"/"TLDs") are a significant indicator for the representativeness of the data, whether the data set or particular crawl is biased towards certain countries, regions or languages.

Metrics about top-level domains are show on the following pages:

* [Groups of TLDs](./tld/groups.md): generic vs. country-code TLDs (e.g., `.com` vs. `.jp`)
* [TLDs of latest monthly crawl](./tld/latestcrawl.md)
* [Estimation of representativeness](./tld/comparison.md): a comparison of a recent crawl with an external data source
* [TLDs of selected crawls](./tld/percentage.md): lists percentage of TLDs for selected crawls from 2013--2021

Note, that top-level domain is defined here as the left-most element of a host name (`com` in `www.example.com`). [Country-code second-level domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-level_domain#Country-code_second-level_domains) ("ccSLD") and [public suffixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Suffix_List) are not covered by this metrics.
